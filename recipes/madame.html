    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      A classic croque madame makes the perfect French-inspired brunch or lunch
      dish. Once you try this, it will be hard to have "just" a ham and cheese
      sandwich again. Don't cheat and use Swiss cheese, this deserves the real
      thing! Using Gruyère cheese will make all the difference.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 tablespoons salted butter, softened, divided</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the
        oven's broiler.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Whisk
        in flour and stir until slightly brown, about 3 minutes. Whisk in milk;
        bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Once boiling, reduce heat
        immediately and simmer for 5 minutes. Add 1/2 of the Gruyère cheese,
        salt, pepper, and nutmeg; heat until cheese is melted, about 2 minutes.
        Remove from the heat and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        Broil in the preheated oven until cheese is almost melted, 2 to 3
        minutes. Remove from the oven, place toast slices together to make 2
        sandwiches and pour remaining cheese sauce on top of each sandwich.
        Return to the broiler until sauce starts to brown, about 2 minutes.
