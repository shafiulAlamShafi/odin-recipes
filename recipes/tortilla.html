    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fry an egg, melt the cheese, and warm your tortilla all in the same pan.
      Add your favorite toppings–like salsa, jalapeño pepper slices, cilantro,
      and green onions–and enjoy a great tasting breakfast, done in a flash. Of
      course, you can repeat, as many times as you like, if you have company.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 teaspoons butter</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon taco seasoning, or to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat, and swirl
        the pan to coat the bottom evenly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Carefully break egg into buttered skillet and cook until egg white is
        opaque and egg is firm enough to turn, about 1 minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        Turn egg over, being careful not to break yolk; sprinkle with taco
        seasoning and about half of cheese
